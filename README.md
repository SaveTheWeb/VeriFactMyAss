**VeriFactMyAss** is an open-source tool designed to analyze the *factual accuracy* of posts on social media platforms (starting with LinkedIn).  
It uses NLP techniques to extract claimed facts, validates them using online sources, and calculates a **veracity score**.

⚠️ This is a work-in-progress. Community contributions welcome.
