# VeriFactMyAss
VeriFactMyAss is an open-source tool that analyzes social media posts to extract factual claims, verify them via web sources and APIs, and compute a transparent veracity score. Designed for researchers, skeptics, and cyber-ethicists who are tired of fact-free influence. ✊ Truth is not an opinion — it’s measurable.
